### Detailed Flow
1. **Image Acquisition**: User uploads or captures a plant image
2. **Preprocessing**: 
   - Image resizing to match model input dimensions
   - Normalization of pixel values
   - Color space adjustments if needed
3. **Feature Extraction**: 
   - The CNN backbone extracts relevant features from the image
   - Transfer learning likely employed to leverage pretrained weights
4. **Model Inference**:
   - Features are passed through the model
   - The model produces classification probabilities
5. **Post-processing**:
   - Interpretation of model outputs
   - Mapping of prediction values to plant species
   - Confidence score calculation
6. **Result Presentation**:
   - Display of top predictions with confidence scores
   - Possibly additional information about identified plant species
